# Advent of Code Solutions

Inputs are stored under `inputs/dayx`. For example, the input for day 1 is in the file `inputs/day1`

To get the answer for a specific day/part, run
```
cargo run --bin dayx-y
```
where `x` is the day and `y` is the part

for example to run day 2 part 1:
```
cargo run --bin day2-1
```
